After denaturation, the biotinylated single-stranded PCR amplicon is isolated and allowed to hybridize with a sequencing primer. Each incorporation event is accompanied by the release of pyrophosphate (PPi) in a quantity equimolar to the amount of incorporated nucleotide. ATP sulfurylase converts PPi to ATP in the presence of adenosine 5' phosphosulfate (APS). This ATP drives the luciferase-mediated conversion of luciferin to oxyluciferin that generates visible light in amounts that are proportional to the amount of ATP.\nFor more information: \nLarge-scale DNA sequencing techniques\n QIAGEN website  \n Illumina technology\n"},"data-analysis.html":{"url":"data-analysis.html","title":"Omics Data analysis","keywords":"","body":"\nQiime v2 - Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology\nThe official site\nQuality assurance - chimeras, sequencing quality filtering\nQWRAP \n\n\n\nQIIME is an open-source bioinformatics pipeline for performing microbiome analysis from raw DNA sequencing data.
